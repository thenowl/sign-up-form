# sign-up-form

A Sign-up Form project as part of The Odin Project's curriculum to demonstrate the design of basic forms.

I also experimented with some logo design for the first using Inkscape, as well as image processing using GIMP.

While the task didn't ask for it, I still implemented some client-side validation of the password fields via JavaScript and have it dynamically instruct the user to use the right pattern. I also implemented a hide/show password functionality and some very basic responsiveness for an improved user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
